Hi! I'm Martin Bjeldbak Madsen, a Danish software developer slash consultant now working halfway across the world at NetEngine in Brisbane, Australia. I have a master's degree in Computer Science from [Aalborg University](http://www.cs.aau.dk/). I enjoy programming, systems architecture, investing, Formula 1, cooking, running, and reading books of all genres.

If you're interested, you can check out my CV [here]({{ site.cv_path }}) or my thesis [here]({{
site.thesis_path }}).
